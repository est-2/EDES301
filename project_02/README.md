# EDES301 Project 02: PCB Design
## Eleanor Tucker
This repository contains EAGLE files and supplementary documentation (bill of materials, Gerber files, etc.) for a PCB based on my Project 01, the Prism Pomodoro. More information about that project can be found in [this repository](linkhttps://github.com/est-2/EDES301/tree/main/project_01).
